# Laravel7-FileFormatUpload-Project
The purpose of this test is to assess your ability to work with various data formats both
as input and output, as well as your ability to interact with a MySQL database.

You can use the PHP framework that you are most comfortable with but PHP Slim
Framework or vanilla PHP are preferred.

Requirements:
Build a file uploader that accepts a CSV, JSON or XML file only and creates a table in a
database with columns that match the structure of the uploaded file, and imports the
file’s data into the table. The table’s name should be the name of the file (without the
extension and in snake case).
Once the data has been imported the user should be able to view the contents of the
table and download the data as an Excel or PDF file.
As many of the components as possible should follow the reusable design pattern.
